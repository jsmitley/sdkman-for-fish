![Tests](https://github.com/reitzig/sdkman-for-fish/workflows/Tests/badge.svg?branch=master)

Makes command `sdk` from [SDKMAN!] usable from [fish], including auto-completion.
Also adds binaries from installed SDKs to the PATH.

Version 2.0.0 has been tested with 

 - fish 3.1, and 
 - SDKMAN! 5.9, on
 - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and macOS 10.15

## Install

With [fisher] (install separately):

```
fisher add reitzig/sdkman-for-fish@v2.0.0
```

_Note:_ 

 - Only compatible with fisher v4 upwards; v3 is no longer supported.
 - You have to install [SDKMAN!] separately.

## Usage

It's all in the background; you should be able to run `sdk` and binaries installed
with `sdk` as you would expect.

## Contribute

When you make changes, 
please run the tests at least on one platform before creating a pull request.

As the tests may mess up your own setup
-- you have been warned! -- 
the recommended way is to run the tests in a Docker container:
 
```fish
docker build -t sdkman-for-fish-tests -f test/Dockerfile .
docker run --rm sdkman-for-fish-tests
```
   
A run configuration for Jetbrains IDEs is included.

It is a also possible to run individual features, for instance:

```fish
docker run --rm sdkman-for-fish-tests features/completions.feature
```

As a corollary, this is the fastest way to run all tests 
(if you do not care about the report):

```fish
for f in features/*.feature
  docker run --rm sdkman-for-fish-tests "$f" &
done
wait
```
